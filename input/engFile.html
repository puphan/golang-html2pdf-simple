        <p>Sample text refers to placeholder content used to demonstrate or preview design, format, or functionality
            before the final content is added. It is often generic and doesn't carry any significant meaning. One of the
            most commonly used forms of sample text is Lorem Ipsum, a pseudo-Latin text that has been in use since the
            1500s.</p>

                        design works well with the content. Whether it's a website, brochure, or book, sample text helps
                        in assessing how readable the content will be once the final text is added.</td>
                    <td>In web development, developers use sample text to see how text blocks will look within the
                        layout. This is particularly useful when creating templates, ensuring the design is responsive
                        and readable across various screen sizes.</td>

                        errors or formatting consistency. </td>
